# This week we will be practicing more with data types.
# Today you will create a dictionary and a list.

# For the dictionary, you will create key:value pairs of food prices. For the list, you will create a list of your playlist.

# Steps
# 1	In your "main.py" create a dictionary of a food table with the following key:value pairs: Chicken = 1.59, Beef = 1.99, Cheese = 1.00, & Milk = 2.50.
# 2	Access the price for each item and store into their own variable. 
# 3	Print the prices for the 4 items.
# 4	Now create playlist, which is a list of the songs in your section's Spotify playlist. Add the songs as strings.
# 5	Print the playlist to see all the songs that you added.
# 6	Index the first song in your playlist.
# 7	The 2nd & 3rd songs are your favorite in this playlist. Access them & create a variable called "fav_songs". Then print it.
# 8	Update your playlist by changing the last song to something else.
# 9	Add another song at the end of the list using append(). Then, print the updated playlist.
# 10 You changed your mind & want to delete the last song you just added. Now print your playlist again.
# 11 How many songs are in your playlist? 
# 12 Sort your playlist in alphabetical order.
